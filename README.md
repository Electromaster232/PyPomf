# Welcome to PyPomf

PyPomf is a new way to create a Pomf-Compattable site powered by Flask

#### Thats neato! How do I install?

~~Simply follow the [wiki](https://github.com/Electromaster232/PyPomf/wiki) to get started~~
The wiki is no longer updated, and I do not support custom instances of this. *(Or atleast, until further notice)*

#### Cool! Where can I use it?

Check out my install of this over at [dj-electro.me](https://dj-electro.me)
